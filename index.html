- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
               into infinity.

- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.
It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!
</p>

<p>
  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!


  
Hallelujah!
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
power to destroy an entire planet.

The oldest children's songs of which we have records are lullabies,
intended to help a child sleep. Lullabies can be found in every human culture.
The English term lullaby is thought to come from "lu, lu" or "la la" sounds made by mothers
or nurses to calm children, and "by by" or "bye bye", either another lulling sound or a term
for good night.[5] Until the modern era lullabies were usually only recorded incidentally in
written sources. The Roman nurses' lullaby, "Lalla, Lalla, Lalla, aut dormi, aut lacta", is
recorded in a scholium on Persius and may be the oldest to survive.
Many medieval English verses associated with the birth of Jesus take the form 
of a lullaby, including "Lullay, my liking, my dere son, my sweting" 
and may be versions of contemporary lullabies.[5] However, most of those used 
today date from the 17th century. For example, a well known lullaby such as 
"Rock-a-bye, baby on a tree top", cannot be found in records until the late-18th 
century when it was printed by John Newbery (c. 1765).
